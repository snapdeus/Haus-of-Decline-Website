            <p>Haus of Decline is an ongoing multimedia project run by two guys called Alex and Stephen. </p>
            <p> It started as a podcast so that we would have an excuse to keep in touch, but grew to also encompass the
                work produced by our respective artistic practices; comics for Alex and programming for Stephen. </p>
            <p>We hope to expand the project even further! Movies! Video Games! Performance Art! Join us on our quest to
                become the ultimate media assholes!</p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, listen to our podcast. It is mostly comedy-oriented, but sometimes we’ll interview
                somebody, and sometimes we’ll talk about our true feelings.
            </p>
            <p>Read our comics. They are about Queer harmony and delightfult scatological gags.</p>

            <p>Enjoy our website and join our Discord. They are Byzantine and they contain fiendish games.</p>
